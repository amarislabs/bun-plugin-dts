A fork of [wobsoriano/bun-plugin-dts](https://github.com/wobsoriano/bun-plugin-dts) with some *enchancements*, (maybe? I'm not sure it matters) and for experimental, personal and learning purposes. It's a Bun plugin to generate TypeScript declaration files, utilizing [dts-bundle-generator](https://github.com/timocov/dts-bundle-generator) internally with a optional file-based cache, because I *totally* can't wait few seconds to generate the d.ts files every time I run `bun run build`.
